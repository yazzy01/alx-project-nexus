## üìù Video Script (5 Minutes Max)

### **[0:00 - 0:30] Introduction (30 seconds)**
**[Screen: Show title slide or GitHub repo]**

**Narration:**
"Hello! I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to demonstrate my Movie Recommendation Backend API, built for the ALX Project Nexus. This is a comprehensive Django REST Framework application that integrates with The Movie Database API to provide personalized movie recommendations, user authentication, and advanced caching features. Let's dive into the live demonstration."

### **[0:30 - 1:00] API Documentation Overview (30 seconds)**
**[Screen: Navigate to http://localhost:8000/api/docs/]**

**Narration:**
"First, let's look at our comprehensive API documentation powered by Swagger. As you can see, we have well-organized endpoints for movies, users, and personal features. The API follows RESTful principles with proper HTTP methods and status codes. Notice the authentication integration and the ability to test endpoints directly from this interface."

**Actions:**
- Show the Swagger UI interface
- Briefly scroll through different endpoint categories
- Highlight the authentication section

### **[1:00 - 1:30] User Registration and Authentication (30 seconds)**
**[Screen: Demonstrate user registration in Swagger UI]**

**Narration:**
"Let me demonstrate the user authentication system. I'll register a new user through the API. As you can see, we have comprehensive validation - the system requires matching passwords and unique email addresses. Upon successful registration, the API returns a user object and an authentication token for secure API access."

**Actions:**
- Open `/api/v1/users/register/` endpoint
- Fill in registration form with sample data
- Execute the request
- Show the successful response with token

### **[1:30 - 2:15] Movie Discovery and Search (45 seconds)**
**[Screen: Demonstrate movie endpoints]**

**Narration:**
"Now let's explore the core movie functionality. The system integrates with TMDb to provide real-time movie data. Here I'm fetching popular movies - notice how each movie includes comprehensive metadata like ratings, genres, and poster URLs. The API also supports advanced filtering by genre, year, and rating. Let me demonstrate the search functionality by searching for 'Avengers' movies."

**Actions:**
- Show `/api/v1/movies/` endpoint with popular movies
- Demonstrate filtering with parameters (genre, year)
- Use `/api/v1/movies/search/` to search for "Avengers"
- Show the rich movie data returned

### **[2:15 - 3:00] Personal Features (45 seconds)**
**[Screen: Demonstrate favorites, ratings, and watchlist]**

**Narration:**
"The system provides personalized features for authenticated users. Using our authentication token, I can add movies to my favorites, rate movies on a scale of 0.5 to 5.0, and maintain a personal watchlist. Notice how the API prevents duplicate entries and maintains data integrity. The system also tracks user activity for analytics and recommendation improvement."

**Actions:**
- Add Authorization token to Swagger
- Add a movie to favorites using `/api/v1/movies/favorites/`
- Rate a movie using `/api/v1/movies/ratings/`
- Add a movie to watchlist
- Show user dashboard with personal data

### **[3:00 - 3:45] Recommendation Engine (45 seconds)**
**[Screen: Demonstrate recommendation endpoints]**

**Narration:**
"The recommendation engine is a key feature of our system. It provides multiple types of recommendations: trending movies, popular movies, genre-based suggestions, and similar movies. The system uses Redis caching to ensure fast response times and tracks recommendation history for continuous improvement. Let me show you different recommendation types in action."

**Actions:**
- Show `/api/v1/movies/recommendations/` with type=trending
- Switch to type=popular
- Demonstrate genre-based recommendations
- Show similar movies for a specific movie

### **[3:45 - 4:15] Performance and Caching (30 seconds)**
**[Screen: Show admin interface or demonstrate caching]**

**Narration:**
"Performance is crucial for user experience. The system implements Redis caching for TMDb API responses, reducing response times by up to 70%. Background tasks using Celery handle data synchronization without blocking user requests. The database is optimized with strategic indexing, and the admin interface provides comprehensive system management capabilities."

**Actions:**
- Show admin interface at `/admin/`
- Demonstrate fast response times by making repeated API calls
- Show database models in admin (movies, users, activities)

### **[4:15 - 4:45] Technical Architecture (30 seconds)**
**[Screen: Show code structure or database models]**

**Narration:**
"The technical architecture follows Django best practices with a clean separation of concerns. We have 10 database entities with proper relationships, comprehensive error handling, and industry-standard security measures. The codebase is well-documented, modular, and production-ready with Docker support for easy deployment."

**Actions:**
- Briefly show project structure in file explorer
- Show database models in admin interface
- Highlight key technical features

### **[4:45 - 5:00] Conclusion (15 seconds)**
**[Screen: Show GitHub repo or contact information]**

**Narration:**
"This Movie Recommendation Backend demonstrates real-world backend development skills including API design, database optimization, caching strategies, and third-party integrations. The complete source code and documentation are available on GitHub. Thank you for watching, and I'm ready to answer any questions about the implementation!"

**Actions:**
- Show GitHub repository
- Display contact information
- End with project links
