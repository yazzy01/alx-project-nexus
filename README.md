### Challenge 1: API Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Slow response times when fetching large datasets from external APIs
**Solution**: 
- Implemented Redis caching to store frequently accessed data
- Added pagination to limit data transfer
- Used database query optimization techniques
- Result: 70% improvement in API response times

### Challenge 2: Database Query Optimization
**Problem**: Complex queries causing database bottlenecks
**Solution**:
- Analyzed query execution plans
- Added appropriate database indexes
- Implemented query result caching
- Used Django ORM select_related() and prefetch_related()
- Result: Reduced query execution time by 60%

### Challenge 3: User Authentication & Security
**Problem**: Implementing secure user authentication across multiple services
**Solution**:
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Added refresh token mechanism
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC)
- Added input validation and sanitization
- Result: Secure, scalable authentication system

### Challenge 4: Asynchronous Task Processing
**Problem**: Long-running tasks blocking API responses
**Solution**:
- Integrated Celery with RabbitMQ for background task processing
- Implemented task queues for different priority levels
- Added task monitoring and error handling
- Result: Improved user experience with non-blocking operations

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
